# Six-Seven Meme Detector

## Overview

This project uses **OpenCV** (Open Source Computer Vision Library) to detect when an individual performs the "six seven" meme gesture in real-time using computer vision techniques.

## What is the "Six Seven" Meme?

The "six seven" meme is a popular hand gesture meme where a person holds up their hands to display the numbers 6 and 7 using their fingers. This gesture has become a recognizable internet meme, particularly in Turkish internet culture, often used to express certain emotions or reactions.

## How It Works

The project leverages OpenCV's powerful computer vision capabilities to:

1. **Capture Video Input**: Access webcam or video feed to monitor hand movements
2. **Hand Detection**: Use OpenCV's detection algorithms to identify hands in the frame
3. **Gesture Recognition**: Analyze finger positions and hand configurations to recognize when someone is displaying the "6" and "7" finger patterns
4. **Real-time Processing**: Process video frames in real-time to provide immediate detection feedback

## Technology Stack

- **OpenCV**: The core computer vision library used for:
  - Image and video processing
  - Hand detection and tracking
  - Feature extraction
  - Pattern recognition
  
- **Python** (expected): For implementing the detection logic and OpenCV integration

## Key Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection
- Recognition of specific finger patterns representing numbers 6 and 7
- Computer vision-based approach for accurate gesture identification
- Potential for use in various applications (entertainment, accessibility, etc.)

## Project Goals

This project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect specific cultural memes and gestures, showcasing how OpenCV can be used for custom gesture recognition tasks.
